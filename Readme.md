# Project Guidelines:

- Topics for the Final Group Project are chosen by the mutual consent and agreement of all group members. Projects must
incorporate Python and perform data analysis and machine learning / deep learning on sizable datasets. The data can include
either tabular dataset that possess at least 25,000 observations and 15-features; image datasets that contain at least 1,000 images;
gridded-array datasets greater than 5GB in size; or some mixture of structured and unstructured data. Choice of datasets,
including information concerning their size, source, and application should be addressed during the Pitch Presentation.

- Projects must include the following components: (1) data processing, (2) exploratory data analysis, (3) at least 2 ML / DL algorithms
compared to some baseline model(s), (4) algorithm fine-tuning, (5) model evaluation metrics, (6) documented Python code in
reports that demonstrates how to implement the analysis, and (7) interpretation of results in context of the research question.
Written reports should highlight sections of Python code and discuss their importance when incorporating each of the above
components

# Project Baseline:

Based on the guidelines you've provided, I can suggest a project idea that incorporates all the required components while using the Chicago crime dataset you mentioned earlier. This dataset is suitable as it likely has well over 25,000 observations and more than 15 features.

Project Idea: Predictive Policing and Resource Allocation in Chicago

Research Question: Can we predict crime hotspots and types in Chicago to optimize police resource allocation?

Here's how this project would address each required component:

1. Data Processing:
   - Clean and preprocess the Chicago crime dataset
   - Handle missing values, especially in coordinates
   - Convert date/time information into usable formats
   - Encode categorical variables (e.g., crime types, locations)

2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   - Analyze crime trends over time (yearly, monthly, weekly, daily)
   - Visualize crime distribution across different areas of Chicago
   - Examine correlations between different types of crimes and various factors (time, location, etc.)

3. ML/DL Algorithms (at least 2) compared to baseline:
   - Baseline: Simple statistical model (e.g., average crime rate per area)
   - Algorithm 1: Random Forest for crime type prediction
   - Algorithm 2: LSTM neural network for time series forecasting of crime rates

4. Algorithm Fine-tuning:
   - Use grid search or random search for hyperparameter optimization
   - Implement cross-validation to ensure model robustness

5. Model Evaluation Metrics:
   - For classification (crime type prediction): Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC
   - For regression (crime rate prediction): RMSE, MAE, R-squared

6. Documented Python Code:
   - Use Jupyter notebooks to document the entire process
   - Include detailed comments explaining each step

7. Interpretation of Results:
   - Analyze which features are most predictive of crimes
   - Discuss the practical implications of the model's predictions for resource allocation
   - Address potential ethical concerns and biases in predictive policing

To implement this project, you'll need to use various Python libraries and potentially big data tools. Here's a starter code snippet to give you an idea of how to begin:



```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('chicago_crime_data.csv')

# Data Processing
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])
df['Year'] = df['Date'].dt.year
df['Month'] = df['Date'].dt.month
df['Day'] = df['Date'].dt.day
df['Hour'] = df['Date'].dt.hour

# Handle missing values
df = df.dropna(subset=['Latitude', 'Longitude'])

# Encode categorical variables
le = LabelEncoder()
df['PrimaryType'] = le.fit_transform(df['Primary Type'])

# Exploratory Data Analysis
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
df['PrimaryType'].value_counts().plot(kind='bar')
plt.title('Distribution of Crime Types')
plt.show()

# Prepare data for ML
X = df[['Year', 'Month', 'Day', 'Hour', 'Latitude', 'Longitude']]
y = df['PrimaryType']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Random Forest Model
rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = rf.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# LSTM Model for time series prediction
# Prepare time series data
time_series = df.groupby('Date').size().reset_index(name='Count')
time_series = time_series.set_index('Date')
time_series = time_series.resample('D').sum().fillna(0)

# Create sequences
def create_sequences(data, seq_length):
    sequences = []
    targets = []
    for i in range(len(data) - seq_length):
        seq = data[i:i+seq_length]
        target = data[i+seq_length]
        sequences.append(seq)
        targets.append(target)
    return np.array(sequences), np.array(targets)

seq_length = 30  # Use 30 days of history to predict next day
X, y = create_sequences(time_series['Count'].values, seq_length)

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Build LSTM model
model = Sequential([
    LSTM(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(seq_length, 1)),
    Dense(1)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, validation_split=0.2, verbose=0)

# Evaluate model
mse = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f'Test MSE: {mse}')

# Plot training history
plt.plot(history.history['loss'], label='Training Loss')
plt.plot(history.history['val_loss'], label='Validation Loss')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Further analysis and interpretation would follow...

```

This project idea and starter code encompass all the required components:
1. Data processing (cleaning, encoding)
2. Exploratory data analysis (visualizations)
3. Two ML/DL algorithms (Random Forest and LSTM)
4. Algorithm fine-tuning (can be expanded with grid search)
5. Model evaluation metrics (classification report for RF, MSE for LSTM)
6. Documented Python code
7. Interpretation of results (partially implemented, to be expanded)

You would need to expand on this code, adding more in-depth analysis, fine-tuning the models, and providing thorough interpretation of the results in the context of resource allocation and predictive policing.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this project idea or the implementation?
